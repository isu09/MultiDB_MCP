Flow of create_table_tool

User gives input → A file path (like data.csv) and a table name (my_table).

Step 1: Read file schema

The file (CSV, Excel, JSON) is read.

From that file, we extract column names and their data types (e.g., user: int, user_name: string).

Step 2: Ask LLM to generate SQL

We send the schema and table name to the LLM (OpenAI).

The LLM generates a CREATE TABLE SQL query in MySQL syntax.

Step 3: Clean the query

The response might come with formatting (like inside ```sql blocks).

We extract only the SQL part to use directly.

Step 4: Execute SQL on MySQL

The SQL query is run against the MySQL database.

This creates the table.

Step 5: Return success message

If table creation is successful → return "Table created successfully!".

If not, errors will be raised (e.g., wrong SQL, DB connection issue).


Generate INSERT template

The LLM creates a SQL INSERT statement based on the table schema.

Uses placeholders for column values instead of actual data.

Example conceptually: INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) VALUES (:col1, :col2)
Here,
1.The LLM is not processing or inserting actual data.

2.It only generates the SQL query template with placeholders (:colname).

3.All the actual row values are handled locally in Python (by pandas and SQLAlchemy).

4.This means you don’t send large amounts of data to the LLM, just the schema and table info, which is very lightweight.

So, the LLM’s role is query generation only, keeping token usage minimal.
